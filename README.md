# Free-Rice-Bot-Chrome-Extension
A simple chrome extension that allows you to answers questions extremely fast on freerice.com(the multiplication mode), and allows you to contribute to solving world hunger :). 

I plan on expanding it further to other modes. 

Instructions: 

1. Open the zip file, and you'll get a folder
2. Type chrome://extensions in your search bar on chrome
3. Turn on developer mode (the option should be at the top right of the page)
4. Then click load unpacked, and then select the freericebot folder

5. Then go to this link: https://play.freerice.com/categories/multiplication-table?level=1 (its the just the multiplication freerice mode, the bot only works for that mode)

6. The extension should already be turned on. However, you will need to refresh the page for it to activate (for some it might just work without having to refresh).

and that's it!

# If you don't have chrome: 
Copy the code from the JacaScript file in the zip file and put it into the console of Inspect Element menu.
